# Student Dashboard

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Student Dashboard application. The application is a web-based platform for managing students, courses, and attendance, designed to be used by educational institutions.

## Technologies Used

The project is built with a modern technology stack:

-   **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
-   **Drizzle ORM**: A TypeScript ORM for building type-safe SQL queries.
-   **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
-   **NextAuth.js**: An authentication library for Next.js applications.

## Setup and Installation

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xml300/student-dashboard.git
    cd student-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the necessary environment variables. You can use `.env.example` as a template if it exists. The typical variables needed are for the database connection and NextAuth.js configuration.

    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
    NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Database Setup

The application uses PostgreSQL as its database.

1.  **Run database migrations:**
    To set up the database schema, run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run db:migrate
    ```

2.  **Seed the database:**
    To populate the database with initial data, run:
    ```bash
    npm run db:seed
    ```

## Available Scripts

The `package.json` file includes the following scripts:

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with hot-reloading.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
-   `npm run start`: Starts the production server.
-   `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase to check for errors and enforce code style.
-   `npm run db:seed`: Seeds the database with initial data.
-   `npm run db:migrate`: Runs database migrations to update the schema.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js application structure:

-   `src/app`: Contains the core application logic, including pages and API routes.
    -   `(main)`: A route group for the main application layout after authentication.
    -   `api`: Contains all the API endpoints for the application.
-   `src/components`: Contains reusable React components used throughout the application.
-   `src/lib`: Contains utility functions, authentication logic (`auth.ts`), and data access functions.
-   `src/db`: Contains the database schema (`schema.ts`), migration scripts, and seeding logic.
-   `drizzle`: Contains configuration and files generated by Drizzle ORM.
-   `public`: Contains static assets like images and fonts.

## Key Components and Features

-   **Authentication**: Managed by NextAuth.js. The configuration can be found in `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` and `src/lib/auth.ts`.
-   **Dashboard**: The main landing page after login, located at `src/app/(main)/dashboard/page.tsx`.
-   **Course Management**: Allows for viewing, adding, and managing courses. The main page is `src/app/(main)/courses/page.tsx`, with API routes in `src/app/api/courses/`.
-   **Attendance Tracking**: Functionality for marking and viewing attendance records. The UI is located in `src/app/(main)/attendance/[sessionId]/page.tsx`.
-   **Device Management**: A feature for managing authorized devices, with the main page at `src/app/(main)/device/page.tsx`.
